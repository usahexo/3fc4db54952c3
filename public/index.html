But with so many providers to choose from, how do you know which one is the best for you?</p>
<p>Here are a few things to consider when choosing a car hire company in Argentina:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Price - how much are you willing to spend on car hire?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Vehicle size - do you need a small or large vehicle?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Location - where in Argentina will you be picking up and dropping off your car?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Availability - is the company’s fleet of vehicles available when you need them?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you’ve narrowed down your options based on these factors, it’s time to start comparing prices. Use a price comparison website such as Kayak or Google Flights to get the best deal.</p>
<p>Finally, don’t forget to read the company’s reviews before making your final decision. This will help you to gauge customer satisfaction and find out any potential problems with the provider.</p>

<p>Some companies include basic liability insurance in the cost of your rental, while others require you to purchase additional coverage. You should be sure to ask about the specifics of the insurance policy before you agree to rent a car.</p>
