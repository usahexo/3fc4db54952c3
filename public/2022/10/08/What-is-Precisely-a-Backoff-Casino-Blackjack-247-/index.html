<p>Like all casino games, blackjack has a house edge that gives the casino a slight advantage over the player. However, by following a few basic rules, the player can reduce the house edge to as low as 0.5%.</p>
<p>The game is played with a standard deck of 52 cards. The goal of the game is to draw cards totalling 21 or less, without going over 21. The player wins if their hand is higher than the dealer’s hand, without going over 21. If the player goes over 21, they lose automatically.</p>

<h1 id="The-Precisely-Details-of-a-backoff-casino-blackjack-247"><a href="#The-Precisely-Details-of-a-backoff-casino-blackjack-247" class="headerlink" title="The Precisely Details of a backoff casino blackjack 247"></a>The Precisely Details of a backoff casino blackjack 247</h1><p>There are plenty of what exactly goes on a backoff casino blackjack 247. So we should start with the basics. Backoff casino blackjack is simply the game that uses exactly two decks of 52 cards. After the players have been given their two cards, the dealer’s up card is turned over. The dealer advances toward twenty-one if possible without exceeding it.<br>In backoff casino blackjack, like traditional casino blackjack, the Ace is worth 1 or 11 points, face cards are 10 points, and other court cards are worth 0 points. All number cards are worth their face value. So, for example, a 3 of hearts would be worth 3 points and an 8 of clubs would be worth 8 points.<br>The object of the game for the player is to draw cards until they reach 21 or come as close to 21 as possible without going bust (exceeding 21). The object of the game for the dealer is to draw cards until they reach 17 or come as close to 17 as possible without going bust.<br>One key difference between traditional blackjack and backoff casino blackjack is that in backoff casino blackjack, you can hit on any number including soft hands (hands consisting of an Ace counted as 11). In traditional blackjack you can only hit on a hard hand (a hand containing no Aces).<br>Another key difference between traditional blackjack and backoff casino blackjack is that in backoff casino blackjack dealers must hit on any hand totaling 16 or less and stand on any hand totaling 17 or more. In traditional blackJack dealers must hit on any hand totaling 16 or less and stand on any hand totaling 17 or more except for Aces which are always hits regardless of their total value.<br>It’s important to remember that in both traditional casino blackJack and backoff casino BlackJack, doubling down is available on any two initial cards and insurance may be taken when the dealer has an Ace showing but this will not be discussed further in this article.<br>Now that we know some of the basic rules of backoff casino BlackJack let’s look at four different scenarios which could occur during a game: </p>
<ol>
<li>Player Draws Card With Value Of 10 Points: In both traditional Casino BlackJack and Backoff Casino BlackJack, if you draw a card with a value of 10 points your turn ends immediately and you do not receive another card unless you bust (go over 21). For example, let’s say you are playing Backoff Casino Black Jack and are dealt an Ace and a 2 giving you a soft hand total of 3. You then draw another 2 which gives you a hard total of 5. Since drawing a card with a value of 10 points automatically ends your turn in both Traditional Casino BlackJack and BackOff Casino Black Jack, you would lose your bet even though you didn’t go over 21 because your final total would be 6 (5 + 1 &#x3D; 6). </li>
<li>Dealer Goes Bust: If the dealer goes bust (exceeds 21), all players still in the game who have not gone bust themselves win an equal amount regardless of their point totals at the time of the dealer going bust. For example, let’s say there are four players still left in the game; Player A has 20 points, Player B has 18 points, Player C has 12 points, and Player D has 10 points. If the dealer goes bust with a total of 23 then each player would win $10 ($30 divided by 4 players) since each player still had at least one point remaining when dealer went Bust. </li>
<li>Dealer Hits On Hand Totaling 16 Or Less: As mentioned earlier, dealers must hit on any hand totaling 16 or less in both Traditional Casino Black Jack as well as BackOff Casino Black Jack except for Aces which are always hits regardless of their total value. So in our previous example where we had four players remaining in the game; let’s say that Dealer E has an Ace showing as their upcard. Since Dealer E must hit on any hand totaling 16 or less they will draw another card which will give them a total of 17. Now since Dealer E has gone over 16 they will Stand instead off hitting again which means that Players A - D all win their bets assuming they have not gone bust themselves in meanwhile.. </li>
<li>Player Wins With Point Total Higher Than Dealer: Let’s say that there are still four players remaining in our game; Players A - D each have different point totals;Player A has 20 points,Player B has 18 points,Player C has 12 points,,and Player D has 10 points . Now if Dealer E draws another card which brings them to 19 then Player A wins since they have more than 19 points while all other players lose since they all have less than 19points at this point</li>
</ol>
