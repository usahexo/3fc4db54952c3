#  Casino Rouge 540 Baccarat Goes to Court in Ownership Dispute

The high-stakes game of Baccarat is at the center of a legal dispute between two casino owners in the heart of the French Riviera.

One casino, Casino Rouge 540, alleges that its former business partner, who operates the other casino, Casino de Monte Carlo, has been stealing its customers.

The case is being heard in a Monaco court.

According to Casino Rouge 540's attorneys, their client noticed a drop in Baccarat revenue after Casino de Monte Carlo opened its own Baccarat salon in late 2017.

They allege that Casino de Monte Carlo has been using underhanded tactics to lure Royale 540's customers away, including offering them lower table limits and free drinks.

In response, Royale 540 is seeking to dissolve its partnership with Casino de Monte Carlo and win back lost revenue damages.

Casino de Monte Carlo denies any wrongdoing and argues that Royale 540's declining revenues are due to market conditions and its own poor management choices.

#  Judge orders Casino Rouge 540 Baccarat to be Sold

On the morning of Tuesday, May 1st, Judge Frollo issued a ruling that Casino Rouge 540 Baccarat must be put up for sale. The casino had been embroiled in a legal battle with the state government since July of last year, when it refused to pay its $540 licensing fee.

The casino's current owner, Monsieur Gaston, stated that he would contest the ruling. "This is an outrage! My casino is a legitimate business, and I will not let the government take it from me!" he shouted outside the courthouse.

Casino Rouge 540 Baccarat is one of the largest and most popular casinos in the city. It is well known for its high-stakes games and luxurious accommodations. If it is put up for sale, it is likely to fetch a high price.

The government has not yet announced what it plans to do with the casino once it is sold. Some officials have suggested that it could be turned into a tourist attraction, while others have argued that it should be used to generate revenue for the state.
