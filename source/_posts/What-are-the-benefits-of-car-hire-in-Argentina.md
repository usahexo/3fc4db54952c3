Argentina is a large and diverse country, making it the perfect place for car hire. But with so many providers to choose from, how do you know which one is the best for you?

Here are a few things to consider when choosing a car hire company in Argentina:

* Price - how much are you willing to spend on car hire?

* Vehicle size - do you need a small or large vehicle?

* Location - where in Argentina will you be picking up and dropping off your car?

* Availability - is the company's fleet of vehicles available when you need them?

Once you've narrowed down your options based on these factors, it's time to start comparing prices. Use a price comparison website such as Kayak or Google Flights to get the best deal.

Finally, don't forget to read the company's reviews before making your final decision. This will help you to gauge customer satisfaction and find out any potential problems with the provider.

#  What should I do if I have a problem with my rental car in Argentina?

If you have a problem with your rental car in Argentina, you can call the rental company’s emergency line. If you are not able to resolve the problem with the rental company, you can file a claim with your travel insurance provider.

#  Are there any restrictions on driving in Argentina?

There are no restrictions on foreigners driving in Argentina. Foreigners can drive with their home country's driver's license for up to 90 days. After that, they will need an Argentinian driver's license.

#  What insurance is included with my car rental in Argentina?

If you are renting a car in Argentina, you will need to purchase insurance. The type of insurance that is included with your rental may vary depending on the rental company.

Some companies include basic liability insurance in the cost of your rental, while others require you to purchase additional coverage. You should be sure to ask about the specifics of the insurance policy before you agree to rent a car.

In addition to liability insurance, you may want to purchase collision coverage or theft protection. This will protect you in the event that your rental car is damaged or stolen.

It is important to note that Argentinian law requires all drivers to have liability insurance. If you are caught driving without insurance, you may face fines and other penalties.
