#  What does 7bit mean? 

In computing, 7bit is the number of bits that are used to represent a character in a single byte. ASCII, the dominant standard for encode text information in computers, uses 7 bits. This means that there are a limited range of characters that can be represented with a single byte- 97 characters in total.

The 7-bit encoding scheme was developed because it requires less storage than 8-bit encoding and it can be transmitted over a communication line faster than an 8-bit code. The smaller encoding size is due to the fact that most characters within languages can be represented by using just the lower seven bits of an eight bit code. 

7-bit ASCII codes were once widely used in text files, e-mail messages, and Usenet postings. However, they have been largely replaced by UTF-8, which uses all 8 bits to encode characters, allowing for a much greater range of characters.
