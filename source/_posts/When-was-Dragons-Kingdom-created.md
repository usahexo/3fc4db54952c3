#  Who created Dragons Kingdom?

The story of Dragons Kingdom begins with two brothers, Alex and Jim, who were always exploring the woods behind their house. One day, they discovered a cave that nobody knew existed. They quickly became obsessed with it and spent every day after school exploring its depths.

One day, they found a mysterious egg in the cave. They took it home and carefully incubated it until it hatched. Out of the egg came a tiny baby dragon! The brothers quickly realized that this was no ordinary dragon – it had magical powers. They named him Draco and swore to protect him with their lives.

The three of them quickly became best friends and spent all their time together exploring the forest and raiding the local farmer's fields for food. Draco grew rapidly, and before long he was the size of a small dog. The brothers taught him how to fly, how to breathe fire, and how to use his other magical powers.

One day, they were flying over the forest when they saw a castle in the distance. It was beautiful – but it looked like it was in trouble. The brothers flew down to investigate and found that the castle was under attack by a horde of goblins! Draco used his fire breath to drive them away and saved the castle from being destroyed.

The people in the castle were amazed at Draco's powers and asked him to stay and protect them. The brothers agreed, and Draco became the first Dragon Lord of Dragons Kingdom. The three of them live there happily ever after!
