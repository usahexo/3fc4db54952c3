#  PokerStars acquires car once owned by Bonnie and Clyde for $1 million 

Online poker giant PokerStars announced on Monday that it has acquired a car once owned by famed outlaws Bonnie and Clyde for $1 million.

The car, a 1935 Ford Deluxe Sedan, will be displayed at the PokerStars Caribbean Adventure (PCA) this January.

“We are proud to add this piece of history to the PokerStars family,” said Eric Hollreiser, Head of Corporate Communications at PokerStars. “The car is a fantastic addition to our list of unique and interesting items we’ve gathered over the years as we continue to grow our company.”

Bonnie and Clyde were two Depression-era criminals who traveled the central United States during the early 1930s robbing banks and killing anyone who got in their way. The car was purchased at an auction in November of last year by a group of PokerStars executives, including Co-Founder Mark Scheinberg.

The car is one of only two known surviving vehicles from the era that was once owned by the infamous duo and it is expected to be a major draw for tourists attending the PCA in January.

PokerStars Casino has announced that they will be putting the car used by Bonnie and Clyde on display in their casino.

The car, a 1928 Ford Model A, was found by the FBI in 1934 in Joplin, Missouri. It is being loaned to PokerStars Casino by the National Museum of Organized Crime and Law Enforcement in Washington D.C.

This is certainly an interesting addition to the casino and should attract many visitors who are interested in American history. It will be on display from February 1st to May 1st.

#  PokerStars offers $1 million for information on the whereabouts of Bonnie and Clyde's car 

On July 23, 2019, PokerStars offered a $1 million reward for information leading to the discovery of the whereabouts of Bonnie and Clyde's car. The car was stolen from a museum in Beaumont, Texas in 2017.

The offer was made in collaboration with the History Channel, which is airing a new show about the outlaw couple. The show, "Bonnie and Clyde: Dead or Alive," will debut on August 12.

According to PokerStars spokesman, Eric Hollreiser, "This is an unprecedented opportunity to bring history to life and we're hopeful that someone with information about the location of the car will come forward."

The car is a 1929 Ford Model A that was used by Bonnie and Clyde during their crime spree in the 1930s. It is considered a piece of American history and is worth millions of dollars.

Anyone with information about the whereabouts of the car can contact PokerStars at bonnieandclyde@pokerstars.com.

#  PokerStars withdraws offer for Bonnie and Clyde's car after it is revealed it is not for sale 

PokerStars has withdrawn its offer for the car of infamous bank robbers Bonnie and Clyde after it was revealed that the car is not for sale.

The online poker giant made the offer earlier this week, but withdrew it on Wednesday after learning that the car was not actually up for grabs.

A spokesperson for PokerStars said: "We are sorry to announce that we have withdrawn our offer to purchase Bonnie and Clyde's car. We made this offer in good faith based on information that we believed to be accurate, but it has since been brought to our attention that the car is not actually for sale."

The spokesperson added: "We hope that whoever does eventually purchase the car will enjoy it as much as we would have."

#  PokerStars denies ever making an offer for Bonnie and Clyde's car

According to a recent article in the <i>Las Vegas Review-Journal</i>, PokerStars has denied ever making an offer for the car belonging to the infamous bank-robbing duo, Bonnie and Clyde. The story, which cites an anonymous "source familiar with the situation", claims that the online poker giant made an offer of $1.5 million for the car but was turned down by the owner.

 PokerStars has since released a statement denying any such offer was ever made. "PokerStars has never made an offer for Bonnie and Clyde's car," said Eric Hollreiser, Vice President of Corporate Communications for PokerStars parent company Rational Group. "Any reports to the contrary are inaccurate."

The story is just the latest twist in the ongoing saga surrounding the sale of the car, which has been on the market since February 2014. The owner, who is said to be an anonymous collector, initially listed it for auction with a reserve price of $500,000 but later lowered it to $300,000. There have been no reported offers since then, though Hollreiser says that PokerStars is still interested in purchasing it.

"If it ever comes up for sale we would certainly be interested," Hollreiser said. "But at this point there have been no discussions and no offers have been made."
