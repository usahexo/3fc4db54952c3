#  How to unlock casino heist in 'Orwell' 

If you're like me, you've been playing 'Orwell' obsessively since it was released last week. The game is a beautiful mix of dystopian future and sleuthing, and I can't get enough of it. 

But there's one feature that's been frustrating me - the casino heist. I can't seem to unlock it no matter how hard I try. 

So today, I'm going to share with you my strategy for unlocking the casino heist in 'Orwell'. And trust me, once you do unlock it, the game is a lot more fun! 

The first step is to make sure you've completed all of the other cases in the game. Once you've done that, head over to the casino and talk to the guy at the front desk. He'll tell you that you need to find three pieces of evidence. 

The first piece of evidence is easy to find. It's in one of the security rooms on the upper level of the casino. Just head up there and look for a cabinet that's labeled "evidence". The second piece of evidence is in a locker near the pool table. The locker code is 9358. And finally, the third piece of evidence is in a safe behind the bar. The safe code is 6296. 

Once you have all three pieces of evidence, return to the front desk and he'll give you a key card to access the casino vault. Head over there and have some fun!

#  How to Open the Diamond Casino Heist in Orwell

The Diamond Casino Heist is one of the most lucrative heists in Orwell. The goal of the heist is to break into the Diamond Casino and steal as many jewels as possible. There are several ways to open the Diamond Casino Heist, and each way has its own benefits and drawbacks. In this article, we will discuss the various ways to open the Diamond Casino Heist and their respective pros and cons.

One way to open the Diamond Casino Heist is by completing all of the side-quests in Orwell. This can be a time-consuming process, but it is one of the easiest ways to unlock the heist. Another way to unlock the heist is by obtaining a high enough ranking on the global leaderboard. This can be difficult, but it is a more rewarding way to unlock the heist than by completing side-quests. The final way to unlock the Diamond Casino Heist is by purchasing it with diamonds. This is by far the most expensive way to unlock the heist, but it also offers the best rewards.

Once you have unlocked the Diamond Casino Heist, you must choose your team members carefully. You will want to select team members who are skilled in stealth, combat, and puzzle-solving. If you do not have enough team members who meet these requirements, you can always hire mercenaries from Orwell's black market.

Once you have selected your team members, it's time to plan your strategy for breaking into the diamond casino. One of the best ways to approach this heist is by using stealth as your main strategy. This requires careful planning and execution, but if done correctly, you can avoid most of the security guards in the casino. Another option is to go in guns blazing and take out all of the security guards. This approach is less risky, but it also has a lower chance of success. Finally, you can try to solve all of the puzzles in the casino in order to avoid fighting any security guards at all. This approach is extremely risky, but it offers potential rewards if successful.

No matter which approach you choose, there are several tips that can help increase your chances of success: 
1) Make sure your team members are well-equipped with weapons and armor; 
2) Use silenced weapons whenever possible; 
3) Avoid detection by cameras and security guards; 
4) Pay attention to environmental hazards; 
5) Stay calm and focused under pressure; 
6) Use teamwork to overcome obstacles; 
7) Be prepared for anything!
