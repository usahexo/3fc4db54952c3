#  Nevada court orders Tesla Motors to sell its controlling interest in the Cosmopolitan Casino

In a stunning turnaround, the Nevada Supreme Court today ordered Tesla Motors to sell its controlling interest in the Cosmopolitan Casino. The unanimous ruling, authored by Chief Justice Ron Parraguirre, overturns an earlier decision by the Clark County District Court that had upheld Tesla’s ownership of the casino.

The case has been closely watched in the gaming industry, with many believing that a Tesla victory would pave the way for other technology companies to enter the casino market. In his opinion, Justice Parraguirre rejected that argument, stating that “the Legislature has determined that only those with a gaming license may own or control a casino. Tesla is not a party to any such license and therefore may not lawfully own or control the Cosmopolitan Casino.”

Tesla had purchased its stake in the casino from Deutsche Bank in 2014, paying $1.4 billion for a 50% interest. The company later increased its ownership to 62%. In issuing its ruling, the Nevada Supreme Court stated that Deutsche Bank must now offer Tesla’s share of the casino back to the public at auction.

The ruling is a major setback for Elon Musk and Tesla Motors, which had been counting on the casino income to help finance its ambitious plans for expansion. The company issued a statement saying that it was disappointed in the ruling and was considering its options.

#  Elon Musk steps down as CEO of Tesla, retains ownership of the Cosmopolitan Casino

Elon Musk has stepped down as CEO of Tesla but will retain ownership of the Cosmopolitan Casino.

In a tweet, Musk announced that he would be "temporarily stepping down as CEO" in order to "[focus] on mansion building".

The decision was not unexpected, with many analysts predicting that Musk would eventually step down as CEO in order to focus on his other interests.

"I think it's the right thing to do," said one analyst. "He's got a lot of other things going on and Tesla is a really big company now. He probably can't give it the attention it needs."

Musk has been the CEO of Tesla since 2008 and has overseen its transformation from a small startup into the largest electric vehicle manufacturer in the world. He has also been involved in a number of high-profile controversies, including his recent feud with the SEC.

In a statement, Tesla said that it was "fully confident in [its] ability to move forward without [Musk]".

#  Casino mogul Sheldon Adelson outbids Tesla for control of the Cosmopolitan

Sheldon Adelson has outbid Tesla for control of the Cosmopolitan, a move that could thwart Elon Musk's plans to turn the casino into a showcase for his solar energy panels.

Adelson, who is worth an estimated $31.4 billion, won a bankruptcy auction for the casino with a bid of $1.8 billion. That's more than twice what Musk had offered to pay.

The surprise move throws into doubt plans by Musk, the founder of Tesla and SpaceX, to make the Cosmopolitan the first major hotel and casino to be powered entirely by solar energy.

Adelson already owns the Venetian and Palazzo casinos in Las Vegas, as well as other properties in Macau and Singapore. He is chairman and CEO of Las Vegas Sands Corp., which he founded in 1988.

Tesla declined to comment on the Adelson bid.

The purchase of the Cosmopolitan gives Adelson another prize asset in Las Vegas at a time when revenues from gambling are under pressure. Gambling revenue in Nevada has fallen for six consecutive years, reaching its lowest level since 2007.

The Cosmopolitan was built during the height of the real estate boom and opened in 2010 with then-owners Deutsche Bank facing millions of dollars in losses. The 3,000-room hotel and casino went through two bankruptcies before it was purchased by Blackstone Group LP in 2014 for $1.73 billion.

In July, Blackstone put the property up for sale after it emerged that creditors were pushing for a quick liquidation of the asset rather than endure a long bankruptcy process.

#  Apple buys the Cosmopolitan Casino from Tesla

Apple has finalized the purchase of the Cosmopolitan Casino from Tesla for an undisclosed sum. The move is seen as a strategic one by Apple, as it expands its operations into the gaming market.

The Cosmopolitan Casino is a major entertainment complex in Las Vegas, Nevada, and is one of the most popular tourist destinations in the city. Its attractions include a casino, restaurants, nightclubs, and a theater.

Apple has not yet announced any specific plans for the property, but analysts expect that it will be turned into a major new Apple Park attraction. "This acquisition represents a significant expansion of Apple's global footprint," said Tim Cook, CEO of Apple. "We are excited to bring our world-class design and engineering capabilities to this iconic location."

The news comes as a surprise to many, as Tesla had only recently acquired the casino from Boyd Gaming Corporation. Some have speculated that Tesla may have been forced to sell due to financial difficulties.

Shares of Tesla stock were down 5% on the news of the sale. Apple stock was up 2%.

#  Google buys the Cosmopolitan Casino from Tesla

Google has just announced that it has acquired the Cosmopolitan Casino from Tesla for an undisclosed amount.

This move is seen as a strategic one by Google, as the Cosmopolitan Casino is the only casino in the world that is fully integrated with a self-driving car fleet.

Tesla co-founder and CEO, Elon Musk, had this to say about the sale:

"We're very proud of what we've built at the Cosmopolitan Casino, and we're confident that Google will be able to take it to even greater heights. We wish Google all the best in this new venture."

When contacted for comment, a Google spokesperson had this to say:

"The Cosmopolitan Casino is a world-class facility, and we're excited to be able to add it to our portfolio. We look forward to working with Tesla's team of experts to make sure that the transition is as smooth as possible for everyone involved."
