natural wonders, stunning scenery and vibrant culture. Exploring this beautiful country by car is the perfect way to see everything it has to offer, and car hire in Argentina makes it easy and affordable.\n\nThere are plenty of reasons to hire a car in Argentina. Firstly, hiring a car gives you freedom and flexibility to go where you want, when you want. There’s no need to worry about schedules or public transport – with your own car, you can explore at your own pace.\n\nSecondly, car hire in Argentina is very affordable. You can find deals that include insurance and unlimited kilometres for as little as $30 per day. This is a great option for budget-minded travellers who want to see as much of Argentina as possible.\n\nFinally, hiring a car in Argentina is the best way to experience the country’s amazing roads and scenery. From the twisting miles of Route 40 to the jaw-dropping peaks of the Andes, there’s no better way to see Argentina than behind the wheel of your own car.\n\n#  How do I choose the best car hire company in Argentina?\n\nArgentina is a large and diverse country, making it the perfect place for car hire. But with so many providers to choose from, how do you know which one is the best for you?\n\nHere are a few things to consider when choosing a car hire company in Argentina:\n\n* Price - how much are you willing to spend on car hire?\n\n* Vehicle size - do you need a small or large vehicle?\n\n* Location - where in Argentina will you be picking up and dropping off your car?\n\n* Availability - is the company's fleet of vehicles available when you need them?\n\nOnce you've narrowed down your options based on these factors, it's time to start comparing prices. Use a price comparison website such as Kayak or Google Flights to get the best deal.\n\nFinally, don't forget to read the company's reviews before making your final decision. This will help you to gauge customer satisfaction and find out any potential problems with the provider.\n\n#  What should I do if I have a problem with my rental car in Argentina?\n\nIf you have a problem with your rental car in Argentina, you can call the rental company’s emergency line. If you are not able to resolve the problem with the rental company, you can file a claim with your travel insurance provider.\n\n#  Are there any restrictions on driving in Argentina?\n\nThere are no restrictions on foreigners driving in Argentina. Foreigners can drive with their home country's driver's license for up to 90 days. After that, they will need an Argentinian driver's license.\n\n#  What insurance is included with my car rental in Argentina?\n\nIf you are renting a car in Argentina, you will need to purchase insurance. The type of insurance that is included with your rental may vary depending on the rental company.\n\nSome companies include basic liability insurance in the cost of your rental, while others require you to purchase additional coverage. You should be sure to ask about the specifics of the insurance policy before you agree to rent a car.\n\nIn addition to liability insurance, you may want to purchase collision coverage or theft protection. This will protect you in the event that your rental car is damaged or stolen.\n\nIt is important to note that Argentinian law requires all drivers to have liability insurance. If you are caught driving without insurance, you may face fines and other penalties.","source":"_posts/What-are-the-benefits-of-car-hire-in-Argentina.md","raw":"---\ntitle: What are the benefits of car hire in Argentina\ndate: 2022-09-09 18:14:19\ncategories:\n- Fiat Argentina\ntags:\n---\n\n\n#  What are the benefits of car hire in Argentina?\n\nArgentina is a large and diverse country, full of natural wonders, stunning scenery and vibrant culture.

The Tigers compete in the American League (AL) Central division. One of the AL's eight charter franchises, the club was founded in Detroit in 1894 as part of the Western League. They are the oldest continuous one name, one city franchise in American professional sports.\n\nThe team is owned by Michael Ilitch and his wife, Marian Ilitch. The Illitches purchased the team from Domino's Pizza founder Tom Monaghan in 1992. Mike Ilitch also owns the Detroit Red Wings of the National Hockey League (NHL).\n\nThe Tigers have won four World Series championships (1935, 1945, 1968, and 1984), 11 American League pennants (1907, 1908, 1909, 1934, 1935, 1940, 1945, 1968, 1969, 1984), and four Divisional titles (2011, 2012, 2013, 2014).\n\n#  What does 7bit mean? \n\nIn computing, 7bit is the number of bits that are used to represent a character in a single byte. ASCII, the dominant standard for encode text information in computers, uses 7 bits. This means that there are a limited range of characters that can be represented with a single byte- 97 characters in total.\n\nThe 7-bit encoding scheme was developed because it requires less storage than 8-bit encoding and it can be transmitted over a communication line faster than an 8-bit code. The smaller encoding size is due to the fact that most characters within languages can be represented by using just the lower seven bits of an eight bit code. \n\n7-bit ASCII codes were once widely used in text files, e-mail messages, and Usenet postings. However, they have been largely replaced by UTF-8, which uses all 8 bits to encode characters, allowing for a much greater range of characters.\n\n#  What Orwell novel was released in 1949? \n\nOrwell’s novel, which was released in 1949, is called Nineteen Eighty-Four.\n\n#  How many players are on a baseball team? \n\nA baseball team typically consists of nine players. These nine players are the pitcher, catcher, first baseman, second baseman, shortstop, third baseman, left fielder, center fielder and right fielder.\n\n#  What do the colors of the Detroit Tigers' logo represent?\n\nThe Detroit Tigers are a Major League Baseball team that was founded in 1894. The team's logo is a blue and orange tiger wearing a baseball helmet.\n\nThe orange in the logo represents courage, strength, and power. The blue in the logo represents speed, agility, and fearlessness. Together, these qualities represent the Detroit Tigers' spirit and competitive drive.","source":"_posts/What-is-the-Detroit-Tigers-team-name-.md","raw":"---\ntitle: What is the Detroit Tigers team name \ndate: 2022-09-23 04:02:02\ncategories:\n- 7bit Casino\ntags:\n---\n\n\n#  What is the Detroit Tigers team name? \n\nThe Detroit Tigers are a professional baseball team based in Detroit, Michigan.

The smaller encoding size is due to the fact that most characters within languages can be represented by using just the lower seven bits of an eight bit code. \n\n7-bit ASCII codes were once widely used in text files, e-mail messages, and Usenet postings. However, they have been largely replaced by UTF-8, which uses all 8 bits to encode characters, allowing for a much greater range of characters.\n\n#  What Orwell novel was released in 1949? \n\nOrwell’s novel, which was released in 1949, is called Nineteen Eighty-Four.\n\n#  How many players are on a baseball team? \n\nA baseball team typically consists of nine players.

The earliest recorded game of chess took place in India in the year 632.\n\n# What are the different variants of the game?\n\nThere are many variants of the game, some of which are:\n- French chess: A variant that uses a slightly different board and pieces than standard chess.\n- Fischer Random Chess: A variant that randomizes the order of the pieces on each player’s home rank at the start of the game. This variant is popular among tournament players as it makes games less predictable.\n- Crazyhouse: A variant where players can capture opponent pieces by dropping them back into the board as their own piece. The captured piece then becomes part of that player’s forces.\n- 3D Chess: A variant where the board and pieces are represented in three dimensions.\n\n#  What are the basic rules? \n\nThere are really only a few basic rules: \n\n1. Keep it clean. This means no cursing, no sexual content, and no excessive violence. \n2. Respect the privacy of others. Do not share pictures or personal information without permission. \n3. Be respectful. Treat others the way you would want to be treated. \n4. Use common sense. If something seems like it could get you into trouble, it probably is.\n\n#  What variations of the game exist? \n\nThere are many variations of the game of golf. The most popular variations are stroke play, match play, and foursome.\n\nIn stroke play, the player with the lowest score at the end of 18 holes is the winner. In match play, the player who wins the most holes is the winner. In foursome, two teams of two players each compete against each other, playing one ball for each side.\n\nThere are also many different types of tournaments, including team tournaments, scrambles, best-ball, and modified alternate shot.\n\n#  How is blackjack typically played in a casino? \n\nCasino blackjack is typically played with six decks of cards. The game begins with each player being given two cards, face down. The dealer is then given two cards, one of which is also face down. Players then take it in turns to either hit (take another card) or stand (stick with what they’ve got). The aim of the game is to reach a score of 21, or as close as possible without going over. If the player’s hand exceeds 21, they automatically lose the round. In the event that both the dealer and player have 21, it is known as a draw and all players still alive in the game will push their bets (ie. neither win nor lose money). \n\nThe player’s hand can comprise any combination of cards totalling as close to 21 as possible. Face cards (king, queen or jack) are worth 10 points each, an ace can be worth either 1 or 11 points and all other numerical cards are worth their face value. So if you are dealt an 8 and a 9, your hand would total 17 points (8+9=17). If you were then to hit again and were dealt an ace, your new hand would total 18 points (1+11+6=18), but if you hit again and were dealt a 2, then your new hand would total 20 points (2+10+8=20). You can only hit as many times as you like provided you don’t go over 21 - at which point you would automatically lose - so if your hand was already at 20 points and you hit again, you would stop hitting (total hand = 21). \n\nIf you are happy with your current total (or don’t want to risk going over 21), you can choose to stand which means that the dealer will then give themselves another card. Once both the dealer and all players have had their turn(s), whoever has the highest value hand wins the round. In case of a draw, the round is re-played until there is a winner.\n\n# Is blackjack a good choice for beginners? \n\nBlackjack can be a good choice for beginners because it is quite straightforward - Hit or Stand according to your totals - and there is scope for some strategic decision-making too. However, bear in mind that blackjack also has one of the lower house edges among casino games (around 0.5%), so it’s important not to get carried away!\n\n#  Who can play blackjack?\n\nBlackjack is a game that anyone can play. Many people think that blackjack is only for people who are experienced in gambling, but this is not the case. Blackjack can be learned fairly easily and once you understand the basic rules, playing the game becomes much easier.\n\nOne of the reasons blackjack is so popular is because it offers players the chance to win a large amount of money with relatively small stakes. In fact, many people enjoy playing blackjack because it gives them the opportunity to win more money than they would if they played other casino games.\n\nAnother reason why blackjack is so popular is that it is a game that can be played by people of all ages. There are no age restrictions when it comes to playing blackjack and this makes it a great choice for both adults and children.\n\nIf you are looking for a casino game that you can enjoy playing with friends or family members, blackjack is definitely a game worth considering.","source":"_posts/What-is-the-origin-of-the-game-.md","raw":"---\ntitle: What is the origin of the game \ndate: 2022-09-26 11:08:03\ncategories:\n- 7bit Casino\ntags:\n---\n\n\n#  What is the origin of the game? \n\nThe game of chess is believed to have originated in North India in the 6th century AD.

In the event that both the dealer and player have 21, it is known as a draw and all players still alive in the game will push their bets (ie. neither win nor lose money). </p>\n<p>The player’s hand can comprise any combination of cards totalling as close to 21 as possible. Face cards (king, queen or jack) are worth 10 points each, an ace can be worth either 1 or 11 points and all other numerical cards are worth their face value. So if you are dealt an 8 and a 9, your hand would total 17 points (8+9&#x3D;17). If you were then to hit again and were dealt an ace, your new hand would total 18 points (1+11+6&#x3D;18), but if you hit again and were dealt a 2, then your new hand would total 20 points (2+10+8&#x3D;20). You can only hit as many times as you like provided you don’t go over 21 - at which point you would automatically lose - so if your hand was already at 20 points and you hit again, you would stop hitting (total hand &#x3D; 21). </p>\n<p>If you are happy with your current total (or don’t want to risk going over 21), you can choose to stand which means that the dealer will then give themselves another card. Once both the dealer and all players have had their turn(s), whoever has the highest value hand wins the round. In case of a draw, the round is re-played until there is a winner.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Is-blackjack-a-good-choice-for-beginners\"><a href=\"#Is-blackjack-a-good-choice-for-beginners\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Is blackjack a good choice for beginners?\"></a>Is blackjack a good choice for beginners?</h1><p>Blackjack can be a good choice for beginners because it is quite straightforward - Hit or Stand according to your totals - and there is scope for some strategic decision-making too.
