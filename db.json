natural wonders, stunning scenery and vibrant culture. Exploring this beautiful country by car is the perfect way to see everything it has to offer, and car hire in Argentina makes it easy and affordable.\n\nThere are plenty of reasons to hire a car in Argentina. Firstly, hiring a car gives you freedom and flexibility to go where you want, when you want. There’s no need to worry about schedules or public transport – with your own car, you can explore at your own pace.\n\nSecondly, car hire in Argentina is very affordable. You can find deals that include insurance and unlimited kilometres for as little as $30 per day. This is a great option for budget-minded travellers who want to see as much of Argentina as possible.\n\nFinally, hiring a car in Argentina is the best way to experience the country’s amazing roads and scenery. From the twisting miles of Route 40 to the jaw-dropping peaks of the Andes, there’s no better way to see Argentina than behind the wheel of your own car.\n\n#  How do I choose the best car hire company in Argentina?\n\nArgentina is a large and diverse country, making it the perfect place for car hire. But with so many providers to choose from, how do you know which one is the best for you?\n\nHere are a few things to consider when choosing a car hire company in Argentina:\n\n* Price - how much are you willing to spend on car hire?\n\n* Vehicle size - do you need a small or large vehicle?\n\n* Location - where in Argentina will you be picking up and dropping off your car?\n\n* Availability - is the company's fleet of vehicles available when you need them?\n\nOnce you've narrowed down your options based on these factors, it's time to start comparing prices. Use a price comparison website such as Kayak or Google Flights to get the best deal.\n\nFinally, don't forget to read the company's reviews before making your final decision. This will help you to gauge customer satisfaction and find out any potential problems with the provider.\n\n#  What should I do if I have a problem with my rental car in Argentina?\n\nIf you have a problem with your rental car in Argentina, you can call the rental company’s emergency line. If you are not able to resolve the problem with the rental company, you can file a claim with your travel insurance provider.\n\n#  Are there any restrictions on driving in Argentina?\n\nThere are no restrictions on foreigners driving in Argentina. Foreigners can drive with their home country's driver's license for up to 90 days. After that, they will need an Argentinian driver's license.\n\n#  What insurance is included with my car rental in Argentina?\n\nIf you are renting a car in Argentina, you will need to purchase insurance. The type of insurance that is included with your rental may vary depending on the rental company.\n\nSome companies include basic liability insurance in the cost of your rental, while others require you to purchase additional coverage. You should be sure to ask about the specifics of the insurance policy before you agree to rent a car.\n\nIn addition to liability insurance, you may want to purchase collision coverage or theft protection. This will protect you in the event that your rental car is damaged or stolen.\n\nIt is important to note that Argentinian law requires all drivers to have liability insurance. If you are caught driving without insurance, you may face fines and other penalties.","source":"_posts/What-are-the-benefits-of-car-hire-in-Argentina.md","raw":"---\ntitle: What are the benefits of car hire in Argentina\ndate: 2022-09-09 18:14:19\ncategories:\n- Fiat Argentina\ntags:\n---\n\n\n#  What are the benefits of car hire in Argentina?\n\nArgentina is a large and diverse country, full of natural wonders, stunning scenery and vibrant culture.
