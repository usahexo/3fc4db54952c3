are the benefits of car hire in Argentina","date":"2022-09-09T10:14:19.000Z","_content":"\n\n#  What are the benefits of car hire in Argentina?\n\nArgentina is a large and diverse country, full of natural wonders, stunning scenery and vibrant culture. Exploring this beautiful country by car is the perfect way to see everything it has to offer, and car hire in Argentina makes it easy and affordable.\n\nThere are plenty of reasons to hire a car in Argentina. Firstly, hiring a car gives you freedom and flexibility to go where you want, when you want. There’s no need to worry about schedules or public transport – with your own car, you can explore at your own pace.\n\nSecondly, car hire in Argentina is very affordable. You can find deals that include insurance and unlimited kilometres for as little as $30 per day. This is a great option for budget-minded travellers who want to see as much of Argentina as possible.\n\nFinally, hiring a car in Argentina is the best way to experience the country’s amazing roads and scenery. From the twisting miles of Route 40 to the jaw-dropping peaks of the Andes, there’s no better way to see Argentina than behind the wheel of your own car.\n\n#  How do I choose the best car hire company in Argentina?\n\nArgentina is a large and diverse country, making it the perfect place for car hire. But with so many providers to choose from, how do you know which one is the best for you?\n\nHere are a few things to consider when choosing a car hire company in Argentina:\n\n* Price - how much are you willing to spend on car hire?\n\n* Vehicle size - do you need a small or large vehicle?\n\n* Location - where in Argentina will you be picking up and dropping off your car?\n\n* Availability - is the company's fleet of vehicles available when you need them?\n\nOnce you've narrowed down your options based on these factors, it's time to start comparing prices. Use a price comparison website such as Kayak or Google Flights to get the best deal.\n\nFinally, don't forget to read the company's reviews before making your final decision. This will help you to gauge customer satisfaction and find out any potential problems with the provider.\n\n#  What should I do if I have a problem with my rental car in Argentina?\n\nIf you have a problem with your rental car in Argentina, you can call the rental company’s emergency line. If you are not able to resolve the problem with the rental company, you can file a claim with your travel insurance provider.\n\n#  Are there any restrictions on driving in Argentina?\n\nThere are no restrictions on foreigners driving in Argentina. Foreigners can drive with their home country's driver's license for up to 90 days. After that, they will need an Argentinian driver's license.\n\n#  What insurance is included with my car rental in Argentina?\n\nIf you are renting a car in Argentina, you will need to purchase insurance. The type of insurance that is included with your rental may vary depending on the rental company.\n\nSome companies include basic liability insurance in the cost of your rental, while others require you to purchase additional coverage.

The Tigers compete in the American League (AL) Central division. One of the AL's eight charter franchises, the club was founded in Detroit in 1894 as part of the Western League. They are the oldest continuous one name, one city franchise in American professional sports.\n\nThe team is owned by Michael Ilitch and his wife, Marian Ilitch. The Illitches purchased the team from Domino's Pizza founder Tom Monaghan in 1992. Mike Ilitch also owns the Detroit Red Wings of the National Hockey League (NHL).\n\nThe Tigers have won four World Series championships (1935, 1945, 1968, and 1984), 11 American League pennants (1907, 1908, 1909, 1934, 1935, 1940, 1945, 1968, 1969, 1984), and four Divisional titles (2011, 2012, 2013, 2014).\n\n#  What does 7bit mean? \n\nIn computing, 7bit is the number of bits that are used to represent a character in a single byte. ASCII, the dominant standard for encode text information in computers, uses 7 bits. This means that there are a limited range of characters that can be represented with a single byte- 97 characters in total.\n\nThe 7-bit encoding scheme was developed because it requires less storage than 8-bit encoding and it can be transmitted over a communication line faster than an 8-bit code. The smaller encoding size is due to the fact that most characters within languages can be represented by using just the lower seven bits of an eight bit code. \n\n7-bit ASCII codes were once widely used in text files, e-mail messages, and Usenet postings. However, they have been largely replaced by UTF-8, which uses all 8 bits to encode characters, allowing for a much greater range of characters.\n\n#  What Orwell novel was released in 1949? \n\nOrwell’s novel, which was released in 1949, is called Nineteen Eighty-Four.\n\n#  How many players are on a baseball team? \n\nA baseball team typically consists of nine players.

The team's logo is a blue and orange tiger wearing a baseball helmet.\n\nThe orange in the logo represents courage, strength, and power.

The earliest recorded game of chess took place in India in the year 632.\n\n# What are the different variants of the game?\n\nThere are many variants of the game, some of which are:\n- French chess: A variant that uses a slightly different board and pieces than standard chess.\n- Fischer Random Chess: A variant that randomizes the order of the pieces on each player’s home rank at the start of the game. This variant is popular among tournament players as it makes games less predictable.\n- Crazyhouse: A variant where players can capture opponent pieces by dropping them back into the board as their own piece. The captured piece then becomes part of that player’s forces.\n- 3D Chess: A variant where the board and pieces are represented in three dimensions.\n\n#  What are the basic rules? \n\nThere are really only a few basic rules: \n\n1. Keep it clean. This means no cursing, no sexual content, and no excessive violence. \n2. Respect the privacy of others. Do not share pictures or personal information without permission. \n3. Be respectful. Treat others the way you would want to be treated. \n4. Use common sense. If something seems like it could get you into trouble, it probably is.\n\n#  What variations of the game exist? \n\nThere are many variations of the game of golf. The most popular variations are stroke play, match play, and foursome.\n\nIn stroke play, the player with the lowest score at the end of 18 holes is the winner. In match play, the player who wins the most holes is the winner. In foursome, two teams of two players each compete against each other, playing one ball for each side.\n\nThere are also many different types of tournaments, including team tournaments, scrambles, best-ball, and modified alternate shot.\n\n#  How is blackjack typically played in a casino? \n\nCasino blackjack is typically played with six decks of cards. The game begins with each player being given two cards, face down. The dealer is then given two cards, one of which is also face down. Players then take it in turns to either hit (take another card) or stand (stick with what they’ve got). The aim of the game is to reach a score of 21, or as close as possible without going over. If the player’s hand exceeds 21, they automatically lose the round. In the event that both the dealer and player have 21, it is known as a draw and all players still alive in the game will push their bets (ie. neither win nor lose money). \n\nThe player’s hand can comprise any combination of cards totalling as close to 21 as possible. Face cards (king, queen or jack) are worth 10 points each, an ace can be worth either 1 or 11 points and all other numerical cards are worth their face value. So if you are dealt an 8 and a 9, your hand would total 17 points (8+9=17). If you were then to hit again and were dealt an ace, your new hand would total 18 points (1+11+6=18), but if you hit again and were dealt a 2, then your new hand would total 20 points (2+10+8=20). You can only hit as many times as you like provided you don’t go over 21 - at which point you would automatically lose - so if your hand was already at 20 points and you hit again, you would stop hitting (total hand = 21). \n\nIf you are happy with your current total (or don’t want to risk going over 21), you can choose to stand which means that the dealer will then give themselves another card. Once both the dealer and all players have had their turn(s), whoever has the highest value hand wins the round. In case of a draw, the round is re-played until there is a winner.\n\n# Is blackjack a good choice for beginners? \n\nBlackjack can be a good choice for beginners because it is quite straightforward - Hit or Stand according to your totals - and there is scope for some strategic decision-making too. However, bear in mind that blackjack also has one of the lower house edges among casino games (around 0.5%), so it’s important not to get carried away!\n\n#  Who can play blackjack?\n\nBlackjack is a game that anyone can play. Many people think that blackjack is only for people who are experienced in gambling, but this is not the case. Blackjack can be learned fairly easily and once you understand the basic rules, playing the game becomes much easier.\n\nOne of the reasons blackjack is so popular is because it offers players the chance to win a large amount of money with relatively small stakes. In fact, many people enjoy playing blackjack because it gives them the opportunity to win more money than they would if they played other casino games.\n\nAnother reason why blackjack is so popular is that it is a game that can be played by people of all ages. There are no age restrictions when it comes to playing blackjack and this makes it a great choice for both adults and children.\n\nIf you are looking for a casino game that you can enjoy playing with friends or family members, blackjack is definitely a game worth considering.","source":"_posts/What-is-the-origin-of-the-game-.md","raw":"---\ntitle: What is the origin of the game \ndate: 2022-09-26 11:08:03\ncategories:\n- 7bit Casino\ntags:\n---\n\n\n#  What is the origin of the game? \n\nThe game of chess is believed to have originated in North India in the 6th century AD.

This variant is popular among tournament players as it makes games less predictable.</li>\n<li>Crazyhouse: A variant where players can capture opponent pieces by dropping them back into the board as their own piece.

The most popular variations are stroke play, match play, and foursome.</p>\n<p>In stroke play, the player with the lowest score at the end of 18 holes is the winner. In match play, the player who wins the most holes is the winner. In foursome, two teams of two players each compete against each other, playing one ball for each side.</p>\n<p>There are also many different types of tournaments, including team tournaments, scrambles, best-ball, and modified alternate shot.</p>\n<h1 id=\"How-is-blackjack-typically-played-in-a-casino\"><a href=\"#How-is-blackjack-typically-played-in-a-casino\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"How is blackjack typically played in a casino?\"></a>How is blackjack typically played in a casino?</h1><p>Casino blackjack is typically played with six decks of cards. The game begins with each player being given two cards, face down. The dealer is then given two cards, one of which is also face down. Players then take it in turns to either hit (take another card) or stand (stick with what they’ve got). The aim of the game is to reach a score of 21, or as close as possible without going over. If the player’s hand exceeds 21, they automatically lose the round. In the event that both the dealer and player have 21, it is known as a draw and all players still alive in the game will push their bets (ie. neither win nor lose money). </p>\n<p>The player’s hand can comprise any combination of cards totalling as close to 21 as possible. Face cards (king, queen or jack) are worth 10 points each, an ace can be worth either 1 or 11 points and all other numerical cards are worth their face value. So if you are dealt an 8 and a 9, your hand would total 17 points (8+9&#x3D;17). If you were then to hit again and were dealt an ace, your new hand would total 18 points (1+11+6&#x3D;18), but if you hit again and were dealt a 2, then your new hand would total 20 points (2+10+8&#x3D;20). You can only hit as many times as you like provided you don’t go over 21 - at which point you would automatically lose - so if your hand was already at 20 points and you hit again, you would stop hitting (total hand &#x3D; 21). </p>\n<p>If you are happy with your current total (or don’t want to risk going over 21), you can choose to stand which means that the dealer will then give themselves another card.

It will feature a 125,000-square-foot gaming floor with 2,500 slot machines and 125 table games.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Where-will-the-new-casino-be-located\"><a href=\"#Where-will-the-new-casino-be-located\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Where will the new casino be located?\"></a>Where will the new casino be located?</h1><p>The new casino is to be built in Springfield, Massachusetts. The announcement was made by MGM Springfield officials on Thursday.<br>“We are incredibly excited to move forward with the development of MGM Springfield and look forward to working with the people of Springfield to create a world-class destination resort that will be a boon to the local economy,” said James Murren, Chairman and CEO of MGM Resorts International.<br>The casino will occupy a nine-acre site on Main Street, just blocks from the state’s capitol building.</p>\n<p>Construction is expected to begin in early 2017 and the casino is scheduled to open in 2018.</p>\n<p>When it opens, MGM Springfield will be the largest commercial employer in the city with more than 2,000 employees.</p>\n<h1 id=\"What-kind-of-amenities-will-be-offered-at-the-new-casino\"><a href=\"#What-kind-of-amenities-will-be-offered-at-the-new-casino\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"What kind of amenities will be offered at the new casino?\"></a>What kind of amenities will be offered at the new casino?</h1><p>The new casino will offer a variety of amenities, including:</p>\n<p>-A luxury hotel with upscale rooms and suites<br>-Several restaurants and bars, including a high-end steakhouse<br>-A spa and fitness center<br>-A large casino with hundreds of slots and table games<br>-An event center that can host concerts and other live performances<br>-And much more!</p>\n<h1 id=\"Which-companies-are-partnering-to-open-the-new-casino\"><a href=\"#Which-companies-are-partnering-to-open-the-new-casino\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Which companies are partnering to open the new casino?\"></a>Which companies are partnering to open the new casino?</h1><p>The new casino is scheduled to open in the spring of 2019. The partnership between the Molson Coors Brewing Company and the Casino company will be responsible for the management and operation of the casino. It is needless to say that this has created a lot of excitement in the area.</p>\n<p>Molson Coors Brewing Company is one of the largest breweries in North America. The company was founded back in 1774 and today they have over 200 brands of beer. Casino is a gaming company that owns and operates gaming establishments all over the United States. This will be their first casino venture outside of the United States.</p>\n<p>The two companies seem like a good match for each other. Molson Coors Brewing Company brings with them their expertise in brewing and distribution while Casino brings their experience in running casinos. It should be an interesting project to watch as it unfolds.</p>\n<h1 id=\"How-many-jobs-will-be-created-by-the-new-casino\"><a href=\"#How-many-jobs-will-be-created-by-the-new-casino\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"How many jobs will be created by the new casino?\"></a>How many jobs will be created by the new casino?</h1><p>Casino-related job creation is a popular topic for conversation, with jobs in the industry ranging from dealers and croupiers to engineers and accountants. With so many different positions available, it can be difficult to estimate just how many jobs will be created by a new casino.</p>\n<p>Recent studies suggest that the number of jobs created by a new casino ranges between 1,000 and 3,000. However, this number can vary greatly depending on the size of the casino and the specific region in which it is located. For example, a large casino in Las Vegas is likely to create more jobs than a small casino in a rural town.</p>\n<p>In addition to the direct jobs created by the casino itself, there are also indirect jobs that are created as a result of increased tourism. Restaurants, hotels, and other businesses that benefit from increased tourism activity will typically hire more employees when a new casino opens in town.</p>\n<p>Overall, it is safe to say that at least 1,000 new jobs will be created by each new casino. While this number may seem small, it is important to remember that these are quality jobs with good salaries and benefits. And when you consider the ripple effect that casinos have on the local economy, it is clear that they are an important part of our workforce.</p>\n"},{"title":"Nevada court orders Tesla Motors to sell its controlling interest in the Cosmopolitan Casino","date":"2022-10-06T14:47:09.000Z","_content":"\n\n#  Nevada court orders Tesla Motors to sell its controlling interest in the Cosmopolitan Casino\n\nIn a stunning turnaround, the Nevada Supreme Court today ordered Tesla Motors to sell its controlling interest in the Cosmopolitan Casino. The unanimous ruling, authored by Chief Justice Ron Parraguirre, overturns an earlier decision by the Clark County District Court that had upheld Tesla’s ownership of the casino.\n\nThe case has been closely watched in the gaming industry, with many believing that a Tesla victory would pave the way for other technology companies to enter the casino market. In his opinion, Justice Parraguirre rejected that argument, stating that “the Legislature has determined that only those with a gaming license may own or control a casino. Tesla is not a party to any such license and therefore may not lawfully own or control the Cosmopolitan Casino.”\n\nTesla had purchased its stake in the casino from Deutsche Bank in 2014, paying $1.4 billion for a 50% interest. The company later increased its ownership to 62%. In issuing its ruling, the Nevada Supreme Court stated that Deutsche Bank must now offer Tesla’s share of the casino back to the public at auction.\n\nThe ruling is a major setback for Elon Musk and Tesla Motors, which had been counting on the casino income to help finance its ambitious plans for expansion. The company issued a statement saying that it was disappointed in the ruling and was considering its options.\n\n#  Elon Musk steps down as CEO of Tesla, retains ownership of the Cosmopolitan Casino\n\nElon Musk has stepped down as CEO of Tesla but will retain ownership of the Cosmopolitan Casino.\n\nIn a tweet, Musk announced that he would be \"temporarily stepping down as CEO\" in order to \"[focus] on mansion building\".\n\nThe decision was not unexpected, with many analysts predicting that Musk would eventually step down as CEO in order to focus on his other interests.\n\n\"I think it's the right thing to do,\" said one analyst. \"He's got a lot of other things going on and Tesla is a really big company now. He probably can't give it the attention it needs.\"\n\nMusk has been the CEO of Tesla since 2008 and has overseen its transformation from a small startup into the largest electric vehicle manufacturer in the world. He has also been involved in a number of high-profile controversies, including his recent feud with the SEC.\n\nIn a statement, Tesla said that it was \"fully confident in [its] ability to move forward without [Musk]\".\n\n#  Casino mogul Sheldon Adelson outbids Tesla for control of the Cosmopolitan\n\nSheldon Adelson has outbid Tesla for control of the Cosmopolitan, a move that could thwart Elon Musk's plans to turn the casino into a showcase for his solar energy panels.\n\nAdelson, who is worth an estimated $31.4 billion, won a bankruptcy auction for the casino with a bid of $1.8 billion. That's more than twice what Musk had offered to pay.\n\nThe surprise move throws into doubt plans by Musk, the founder of Tesla and SpaceX, to make the Cosmopolitan the first major hotel and casino to be powered entirely by solar energy.\n\nAdelson already owns the Venetian and Palazzo casinos in Las Vegas, as well as other properties in Macau and Singapore. He is chairman and CEO of Las Vegas Sands Corp., which he founded in 1988.\n\nTesla declined to comment on the Adelson bid.\n\nThe purchase of the Cosmopolitan gives Adelson another prize asset in Las Vegas at a time when revenues from gambling are under pressure. Gambling revenue in Nevada has fallen for six consecutive years, reaching its lowest level since 2007.\n\nThe Cosmopolitan was built during the height of the real estate boom and opened in 2010 with then-owners Deutsche Bank facing millions of dollars in losses. The 3,000-room hotel and casino went through two bankruptcies before it was purchased by Blackstone Group LP in 2014 for $1.73 billion.\n\nIn July, Blackstone put the property up for sale after it emerged that creditors were pushing for a quick liquidation of the asset rather than endure a long bankruptcy process.\n\n#  Apple buys the Cosmopolitan Casino from Tesla\n\nApple has finalized the purchase of the Cosmopolitan Casino from Tesla for an undisclosed sum. The move is seen as a strategic one by Apple, as it expands its operations into the gaming market.\n\nThe Cosmopolitan Casino is a major entertainment complex in Las Vegas, Nevada, and is one of the most popular tourist destinations in the city. Its attractions include a casino, restaurants, nightclubs, and a theater.\n\nApple has not yet announced any specific plans for the property, but analysts expect that it will be turned into a major new Apple Park attraction. \"This acquisition represents a significant expansion of Apple's global footprint,\" said Tim Cook, CEO of Apple. \"We are excited to bring our world-class design and engineering capabilities to this iconic location.\"\n\nThe news comes as a surprise to many, as Tesla had only recently acquired the casino from Boyd Gaming Corporation. Some have speculated that Tesla may have been forced to sell due to financial difficulties.\n\nShares of Tesla stock were down 5% on the news of the sale. Apple stock was up 2%.\n\n#  Google buys the Cosmopolitan Casino from Tesla\n\nGoogle has just announced that it has acquired the Cosmopolitan Casino from Tesla for an undisclosed amount.\n\nThis move is seen as a strategic one by Google, as the Cosmopolitan Casino is the only casino in the world that is fully integrated with a self-driving car fleet.\n\nTesla co-founder and CEO, Elon Musk, had this to say about the sale:\n\n\"We're very proud of what we've built at the Cosmopolitan Casino, and we're confident that Google will be able to take it to even greater heights. We wish Google all the best in this new venture.\"\n\nWhen contacted for comment, a Google spokesperson had this to say:\n\n\"The Cosmopolitan Casino is a world-class facility, and we're excited to be able to add it to our portfolio.

The game is simple to play and offers relatively good odds for the player when compared to other casino games.\n\nLike all casino games, blackjack has a house edge that gives the casino a slight advantage over the player. However, by following a few basic rules, the player can reduce the house edge to as low as 0.5%.\n\nThe game is played with a standard deck of 52 cards. The goal of the game is to draw cards totalling 21 or less, without going over 21. The player wins if their hand is higher than the dealer's hand, without going over 21. If the player goes over 21, they lose automatically.\n\nThe game begins with both the player and dealer receiving two cards each. The player can choose to either take another card (hit) or stand pat (stick). The dealer must hit on 16 or below and stand on 17 or above.\n\nAfter all players have finished their turns, the dealer reveals their hidden card and compares it against the players' hands. The highest hand wins and ties are broken by comparing the second highest card in each hand.

So we should start with the basics. Backoff casino blackjack is simply the game that uses exactly two decks of 52 cards. After the players have been given their two cards, the dealer's up card is turned over. The dealer advances toward twenty-one if possible without exceeding it.\nIn backoff casino blackjack, like traditional casino blackjack, the Ace is worth 1 or 11 points, face cards are 10 points, and other court cards are worth 0 points. All number cards are worth their face value. So, for example, a 3 of hearts would be worth 3 points and an 8 of clubs would be worth 8 points.\nThe object of the game for the player is to draw cards until they reach 21 or come as close to 21 as possible without going bust (exceeding 21). The object of the game for the dealer is to draw cards until they reach 17 or come as close to 17 as possible without going bust.\nOne key difference between traditional blackjack and backoff casino blackjack is that in backoff casino blackjack, you can hit on any number including soft hands (hands consisting of an Ace counted as 11). In traditional blackjack you can only hit on a hard hand (a hand containing no Aces). \nAnother key difference between traditional blackjack and backoff casino blackjack is that in backoff casino blackjack dealers must hit on any hand totaling 16 or less and stand on any hand totaling 17 or more. In traditional blackJack dealers must hit on any hand totaling 16 or less and stand on any hand totaling 17 or more except for Aces which are always hits regardless of their total value. \nIt's important to remember that in both traditional casino blackJack and backoff casino BlackJack, doubling down is available on any two initial cards and insurance may be taken when the dealer has an Ace showing but this will not be discussed further in this article. \nNow that we know some of the basic rules of backoff casino BlackJack let's look at four different scenarios which could occur during a game: \n1) Player Draws Card With Value Of 10 Points: In both traditional Casino BlackJack and Backoff Casino BlackJack, if you draw a card with a value of 10 points your turn ends immediately and you do not receive another card unless you bust (go over 21). For example, let's say you are playing Backoff Casino Black Jack and are dealt an Ace and a 2 giving you a soft hand total of 3. You then draw another 2 which gives you a hard total of 5. Since drawing a card with a value of 10 points automatically ends your turn in both Traditional Casino BlackJack and BackOff Casino Black Jack, you would lose your bet even though you didn't go over 21 because your final total would be 6 (5 + 1 = 6). \n2) Dealer Goes Bust: If the dealer goes bust (exceeds 21), all players still in the game who have not gone bust themselves win an equal amount regardless of their point totals at the time of the dealer going bust. For example, let's say there are four players still left in the game; Player A has 20 points, Player B has 18 points, Player C has 12 points, and Player D has 10 points. If the dealer goes bust with a total of 23 then each player would win $10 ($30 divided by 4 players) since each player still had at least one point remaining when dealer went Bust. \n3) Dealer Hits On Hand Totaling 16 Or Less: As mentioned earlier, dealers must hit on any hand totaling 16 or less in both Traditional Casino Black Jack as well as BackOff Casino Black Jack except for Aces which are always hits regardless of their total value. So in our previous example where we had four players remaining in the game; let's say that Dealer E has an Ace showing as their upcard. Since Dealer E must hit on any hand totaling 16 or less they will draw another card which will give them a total of 17. Now since Dealer E has gone over 16 they will Stand instead off hitting again which means that Players A - D all win their bets assuming they have not gone bust themselves in meanwhile.. \n4) Player Wins With Point Total Higher Than Dealer: Let's say that there are still four players remaining in our game; Players A - D each have different point totals;Player A has 20 points,Player B has 18 points,Player C has 12 points,,and Player D has 10 points . Now if Dealer E draws another card which brings them to 19 then Player A wins since they have more than 19 points while all other players lose since they all have less than 19points at this point","source":"_posts/What-is-Precisely-a-Backoff-Casino-Blackjack-247-.md","raw":"---\ntitle: What is Precisely a Backoff Casino Blackjack 247 \ndate: 2022-10-08 11:19:00\ncategories:\n- blackjack 247\ntags:\n---\n\n\n#  What is Precisely a Backoff Casino Blackjack 247? \n\nWhen you have played blackjack at a physical casino, you may be curious about what happens if you do not live close enough to one to enjoy the game in person.

So we should start with the basics. Backoff casino blackjack is simply the game that uses exactly two decks of 52 cards. After the players have been given their two cards, the dealer’s up card is turned over. The dealer advances toward twenty-one if possible without exceeding it.<br>In backoff casino blackjack, like traditional casino blackjack, the Ace is worth 1 or 11 points, face cards are 10 points, and other court cards are worth 0 points. All number cards are worth their face value. So, for example, a 3 of hearts would be worth 3 points and an 8 of clubs would be worth 8 points.<br>The object of the game for the player is to draw cards until they reach 21 or come as close to 21 as possible without going bust (exceeding 21). The object of the game for the dealer is to draw cards until they reach 17 or come as close to 17 as possible without going bust.<br>One key difference between traditional blackjack and backoff casino blackjack is that in backoff casino blackjack, you can hit on any number including soft hands (hands consisting of an Ace counted as 11). In traditional blackjack you can only hit on a hard hand (a hand containing no Aces).<br>Another key difference between traditional blackjack and backoff casino blackjack is that in backoff casino blackjack dealers must hit on any hand totaling 16 or less and stand on any hand totaling 17 or more. In traditional blackJack dealers must hit on any hand totaling 16 or less and stand on any hand totaling 17 or more except for Aces which are always hits regardless of their total value.<br>It’s important to remember that in both traditional casino blackJack and backoff casino BlackJack, doubling down is available on any two initial cards and insurance may be taken when the dealer has an Ace showing but this will not be discussed further in this article.<br>Now that we know some of the basic rules of backoff casino BlackJack let’s look at four different scenarios which could occur during a game: </p>\n<ol>\n<li>Player Draws Card With Value Of 10 Points: In both traditional Casino BlackJack and Backoff Casino BlackJack, if you draw a card with a value of 10 points your turn ends immediately and you do not receive another card unless you bust (go over 21). For example, let’s say you are playing Backoff Casino Black Jack and are dealt an Ace and a 2 giving you a soft hand total of 3. You then draw another 2 which gives you a hard total of 5. Since drawing a card with a value of 10 points automatically ends your turn in both Traditional Casino BlackJack and BackOff Casino Black Jack, you would lose your bet even though you didn’t go over 21 because your final total would be 6 (5 + 1 &#x3D; 6). </li>\n<li>Dealer Goes Bust: If the dealer goes bust (exceeds 21), all players still in the game who have not gone bust themselves win an equal amount regardless of their point totals at the time of the dealer going bust. For example, let’s say there are four players still left in the game; Player A has 20 points, Player B has 18 points, Player C has 12 points, and Player D has 10 points. If the dealer goes bust with a total of 23 then each player would win $10 ($30 divided by 4 players) since each player still had at least one point remaining when dealer went Bust. </li>\n<li>Dealer Hits On Hand Totaling 16 Or Less: As mentioned earlier, dealers must hit on any hand totaling 16 or less in both Traditional Casino Black Jack as well as BackOff Casino Black Jack except for Aces which are always hits regardless of their total value. So in our previous example where we had four players remaining in the game; let’s say that Dealer E has an Ace showing as their upcard. Since Dealer E must hit on any hand totaling 16 or less they will draw another card which will give them a total of 17. Now since Dealer E has gone over 16 they will Stand instead off hitting again which means that Players A - D all win their bets assuming they have not gone bust themselves in meanwhile.. </li>\n<li>Player Wins With Point Total Higher Than Dealer: Let’s say that there are still four players remaining in our game; Players A - D each have different point totals;Player A has 20 points,Player B has 18 points,Player C has 12 points,,and Player D has 10 points . Now if Dealer E draws another card which brings them to 19 then Player A wins since they have more than 19 points while all other players lose since they all have less than 19points at this point</li>\n</ol>\n","site":{"data":{}},"excerpt":"","more":"<h1 id=\"What-is-Precisely-a-Backoff-Casino-Blackjack-247\"><a href=\"#What-is-Precisely-a-Backoff-Casino-Blackjack-247\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"What is Precisely a Backoff Casino Blackjack 247?\"></a>What is Precisely a Backoff Casino Blackjack 247?</h1><p>When you have played blackjack at a physical casino, you may be curious about what happens if you do not live close enough to one to enjoy the game in person.
